This is just a backup of my Modded B O R D E R L A N D S 3 mod experience, with some tweaks here and there like some improvements how the sniper/shotgun works.
Example:
  Shotguns have zero benefits from crits, but higher damage, encouraging close range engaments.
  Snipers have terrible BodyShot Damages but 10x Critical Damage to encourage players who want to stay afar helping their coop friend from afair and dealing/prioritazing boss enemies.
I Dont rememnber what else i did now.
Change to rarities because i was so f tired of the epic/higher tiers weapon models showing up (pls to god, make modders able to import 3D model weapons in this goddamn game)
Tried to make the game had harder enemies comparable to your level, to sort of like get that experience of grinding/level up in old school RPG to actually encourage the player to keep around the area getting exp before being able to moving on.
Oh and i did improve the controller aim assist because i noticed that my cousin playing with a controller had a worst gameplay maneauver/experience/whatever, so i did somethings

Anyway bye
