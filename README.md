# Borderlands 3 Mod Backup

This is just a backup of my Modded **B O R D E R L ... 3** mod experience (yes i dont want to say the name of the game because i dont want this repo to be a replacement from their original creators), with some tweaks here and there like some improvements how the sniper/shotgun works.

---

## Examples of Changes
- **Shotguns**  
  Shotguns have zero benefits from crits, but higher damage, encouraging close range engaments.  

- **Snipers**  
  Snipers have terrible BodyShot Damages but 10x Critical Damage to encourage players who want to stay afar helping their coop friend from afair and dealing/prioritazing boss enemies.

---

## Other Tweaks
- I Dont rememnber what else i did now.
- Change to rarities because i was so f tired of the epic/higher/whatever-name tiers weapon models showing up everytime, and i realise i actually liked more the normal weapon models. (pls to god, make modders able to import 3D model weapons in this goddamn game).
- Tried to make the game had harder enemies comparable to your level, to sort of like get that experience of grinding/level up like in old school RPG to actually encourage the player to keep around the area getting exp before being able to moving on.
- Oh and i did improve the controller aim assist because i noticed that my cousin playing next to me on a splitscreen on ASTERPRO with a controller had a worst gameplay maneauver/experience/whatever than me, so i did somethings.
